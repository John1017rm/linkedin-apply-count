## What We Collect  
This extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data.  

## How It Works

- It checks the current LinkedIn job page and displays the applicant count using public data visible on the page.
- No external servers are contacted, and no data is shared or tracked.

## Data Sharing  
We do **not** sell, share, or transfer any user data to third parties.

## Permissions  
This extension uses the following Chrome permissions:
- `activeTab`: to detect when you are on a LinkedIn job page.
- `scripting`: to extract the job ID from the current page.
- `cookies`: to retrieve the LinkedIn CSRF token to access the API.
- `storage`: for future optional settings.
